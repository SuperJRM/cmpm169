				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The program is using a fractal structure, recursively creating branches to generate various bolts of electricity. Unfortunately, I was unable to get sound to work in VS Code.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>After doing this experiment by myself, I feel like I learned a lot about generative art. Adjusting how lines are drawn, planning 
					for recursion, and even learning how to implement audio in p5.js, while new to me, was a very fulfilling experience that 
					showed me a lot in terms of the kind of work that goes into generative art, which has a significant human element despite its 
					name’s implication. 
					In terms of lows, the biggest were the times where I couldn’t figure out where to go next, even after manipulating random 
					values. Oftentimes, the only way to solve them was to just do something else for a bit, which eventually allowed me to see the 
					obvious details I was clearly missing. (Edit: A big low ended up being that I was unable to implement the sound outside of the 
					p5.js web editor within a reasonable timeframe.Though I’m a bit disappointed, I hope to be able to learn how to do so in the 
					near future outside of this experiment.)
					The highs were definitely the moments after big accomplishments and lots of work, like when I was finally able to get clean 
					paths, when I finished the basic state system, and when I got audio fully working, all of which brought the experiment feeling 
					closer to my vision.
