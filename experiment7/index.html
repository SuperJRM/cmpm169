				<p>Working with Tyler again was pretty fun and it was nice having help! I had originally come up with the theme, alongside the general structure of the concept and code. I then pulled up relevant data from reliable sources, and built off of Tylerâ€™s later framework and calculations. Given our cooperative coding style, I feel that the work was pretty evenly split, and am pretty proud of the final outcome! The highs were seeing it work in action, but the lows definitely came from knowing that the calculations did end up being a bit inaccurate due to the lack of information. Overall, though, I like how the project turned out and had a lot of fun making it with Tyler!
