				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Sit back and enjoy the surreal brainwashing! Best enjoyed in full screen mode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>A random GIF is displayed every 3 seconds by storing URLs of GIFs and loading them into an array where they are pulled onto the 
					screen. The name of the tag is flashed on top of the GIF, and spoken using a text-to-speech function.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the first experiment I worked on with a partner, which was a pretty different experience to how I normally did these 
					assignments. I had originally come up with the sleeper agent idea, alongside the general structure of how the experiment would 
					be laid out code-wise. Pulling up the 3D text and Giphy examples, I reverse-engineered their structures to find out how they 
					functioned, and once Tyler got the skeleton code working, I changed the systems to match the timer rather than user interaction 
					and got the new tag generation system working. I think we did a really good job getting the original vision across, and I feel 
					that we split the work pretty evenly, all things considered. The highs of the projects were definitely the full implementation 
					of the gifs and text, since that felt like a huge jump in progress visually. The lows definitely had to do with starting the 
					project, since neither of us were too experienced with APIs so we had a hard time understanding the original example. Overall, 
					though, I think the project is something pretty unique that weâ€™re both really proud of!
