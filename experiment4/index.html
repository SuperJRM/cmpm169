				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using the webcam as an input, pixels are grabbed from the frame and their color data is stored from the pixels array. From there, 
					the image goes through a threshold filter, turning the image grayscale. Each black pixel is then given the original RGBA values 
					of the next white filtered pixel, creating a colored outline of the original input. Going through the pixel array of the filtered 
					image, each white pixel is made black, giving the image a black background and allowing the colored outlines to be easily detectible.
					The coordinates of the outlines' pixels are then found using the pixels array, which are used with its color values to create
					colored lines stemming from the outline, resulting in a blurred effect.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	Completing this experiment by myself, I learned a lot about how images and video are displayed through p5.js, as I got very familiar with their implementation along with the pixels array. The highs definitely came from moments where I felt closer to my goal of a finished project, specifically when I got the image’s outlines rendered with the black background and when I figured out how the video worked using Wes’ example from class and the p5.js documentation. The lowest low was definitely struggling to figure out why the lines weren’t lining up with the sprites properly. It definitely cost me a lot of hours and was a big reason for why the project was finished so late, but I’m glad it’s over with. The relief that came from moving on was amazing, and I’m pretty proud of how everything turned out in the end.
