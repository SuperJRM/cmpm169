				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Eighteen rows of rings, each containing a random number of cubes, constantly lerp their positions toward the dragging mouse.
					Alongside this, each ring has their cubes and their distances from the canter change using a modified sine function, with each
					ring rotating along the X-axis using a modified 1/x function. The rings are then rotated along the Z-axis depending on the 
					mouse's position on the Y-axis. A directional light is used to illuminate the boxes' metallic textures.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	Completing this project by myself, I feel like I was able to gain a really strong grasp on how 3D works in p5.js, especially with how one would manipulate the 3 axes. The highs definitely came from the end of the project where I finally reached a point where the experiment was something I actually thought looked cool. The lows for the project probably came from the initial struggle to wrap my head around 3D rotations. The mistakes were simple enough, to the point where I didnâ€™t really feel that noting them in my documentation was important, but over time I really felt like I was struggling until it all clicked by the end. However, I can safely say that I am now experienced in 3D when it comes to p5.js!
