				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>By clicking on the screen, the wall of gears will rotate, mimicking cogs in a machine!</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The gears are drawn in a function, which is then called and translated 100 times. Each of the gears have 
					their rotation values stored in 2D arrays, which are individually called per gear as they're drawn in order
					to rotate. Upon clicking near a gear, the speed of the gear's rotation will increase, as well as any neighboring gears to a 
					lesser degree, unitl their speeds eventually decrease and the gear slows to a stop over time.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	I did this experiment completely by myself, and found the entire experience very unique. I had never worked in p5.js before, 
					and it was very interesting to work in an environment where items had to be drawn each frame, rather than having objects 
					which could be saved.
					In terms of difficulties, one of the biggest ones was finding out why the gears were stuck together. I had messed around with 
					several inputs for translations, as well as where the translations were called, trying to find a combination with good results, 
					which I did eventually get to. Another big issue was trying to figure out why the gears, when separated, had issues spinning. 
					I ended up rewriting a lot of code, undoing those rewrites, and even making a new function for drawing the gears in order to 
					isolate the issue. At one point, I even wondered if the issue was with my 2D array implementation and if p5.js was somehow 
					struggling with it, though that thankfully wasn’t the case. Finding the solution to this, however, was the biggest epiphany 
					I had felt in a while, though I definitely felt a bit stupid for forgetting about changing an entire function of my code.
					In regards to the project’s highs, the most notable moments were seeing the gear finally spin smoothly, then seeing the full 
					array of gears laid out, then seeing the final output where the neighboring gears would spin as well. Overall, the project had 
					many small victories, which left me feeling proud of my work by the end of it. I learned to feel confident in my coding skills, 
					even with a new language and environment, and enjoyed my time with it!
