				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Play Rock Paper Scissors with two players, then hit space or click the button to record your score! Best played a few feet away. Button broken in fullscreen.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Uses ml5.js to detect hand gestures and uses arrays to store each player's score, hand, and keypoint data.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with Tyler again was really fun! I brought up the initial ml5.js concept and found resources for learning it. I also started the initial keypoint structure that Tyler finished. Finally, I created the scoring system and final look of the experiment. I like to think I took away a lot from this project about ml5, and I think we did a pretty good job evenly splitting the work. I'm also proud that we were able to create something with ml5 that’s fun and works exactly as we intended! Highs for the project was definitely getting both hand gestures to work within the frame of the rock, paper, scissors game, since it was fun seeing our progress work and playtesting everything. There weren’t too many lows aside from the standard bug fixes and internet issues, which I’m happy about!
